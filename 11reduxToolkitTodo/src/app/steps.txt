1. configure store using redux toolkit 
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

then we'll assign configureStore to a variable which we are gonna export
this configureStore store will take an object but it is still not ready to use


after this we'll create reducers
-in this we'll import createSlice & nanoid(this will generate unique id's)
-then we'll initialize One variable called "initialState" with one array called todo in this array we are having onr basic object having id & text properties.

- then we are assigning "createSlice" to a variable which we are gonna exporting. 
- this "createSlice" takes objects in which objects has property called name & initialState 3rd property is reducers. This reducers will properties & functions where addtodo & removetodo are properties and assigned function is a declaration of function 

[Remember : Whatever methods you are accepting in reducers, will always have access for 2 parameters called "state" & "action", this State gives us Current state, and actions contains data whichever has been passed]
